# Pneumonia-Detection
Detecting if a patient has pneumonia or not, in an chest-x-ray, using image classification. This information will make it easier for the machine to spot a possible threat, where a Doctor, maybe, can not.

## Project Scenario
Working for a hospital that wants to make detecting pneumonia in patients easier. This is the case becuase majority of their patients that were given a chest x-ray were given a result of negative when their actual results were positive, making majority of the predictions flase negative.
The hospital want's to give their patients a more accurate result using a machine learning model that is able to surpass a doctor's sight.
