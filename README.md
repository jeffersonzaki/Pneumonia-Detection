# Pneumonia-Detection
Detecting if a patient has pneumonia or not, in an chest-x-ray, using image classification. This information will make it easier for the machine to spot a possible threat, where a Doctor, maybe, can not.

## Content Summary
- [Data](https://github.com/jeffersonzaki/Pneumonia-Detection/tree/master/Image-Data) - Filled with two classes of Chest X-rays, Chest X-rays with a normal scan, and Chest X-rays with Pneumonia

- [Gitignore File](https://github.com/jeffersonzaki/Pneumonia-Detection/blob/master/.gitignore) - Contains file that were too large from AWS, such as the saved model and weights file from the second hyperparameter tuning. 

- [README](https://github.com/jeffersonzaki/Pneumonia-Detection/blob/master/README.md) - Information about this project.

- [Convolutional Neural Network Notebook](https://github.com/jeffersonzaki/Pneumonia-Detection/blob/master/cnn.ipynb) - Notebook on the process of getting to the neural network, and the results of each.

- [Saved Model](https://github.com/jeffersonzaki/Pneumonia-Detection/blob/master/model.hdf5) - A heirarchy file of the saved model (the first model).

- [Saved Weights](https://github.com/jeffersonzaki/Pneumonia-Detection/blob/master/weights.hdf5) - A heirarchy file of the saved weights of the first model.

## Project Scenario
Working for a hospital that wants to make detecting pneumonia in patients easier. This is the case becuase majority of their patients that were given a chest x-ray were given a result of negative when their actual results were positive, making majority of the predictions flase negative.
The hospital want's to give their patients a more accurate result using a machine learning model that is able to surpass a doctor's sight.
